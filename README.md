# Bokeh Visualizations

## Introduction
This repository demonstrates various data visualizations using Bokeh, a Python interactive visualization library. Bokeh allows you to create interactive plots for better exploration and understanding of your data.

## Installation
To run the code, make sure you have Bokeh installed. You can install it using the following command:
"
pip install bokeh
Bokeh Version
Ensure you have Bokeh version 3.2.2 installed by running:
"
python
Copy code
import bokeh
print(bokeh.__version__)
Basic Plotting
Basic line plots, circle glyphs, square glyphs, multiple lines, wedge glyphs, and annular wedge glyphs are demonstrated using Bokeh.

## Combine Circle and Line on a Plot
A combined plot with both line and circle glyphs is showcased.

## Bar Plot and Vertical Bar Plot
Examples of horizontal and vertical bar plots are provided.

##  Scatter Plot, Area Plot, and Patch Plot
Demonstrations of scatter plots, area plots, and patch plots using random and predefined data.

##  Map Geo Data Using Bokeh
The code showcases how to use Bokeh to create maps with geo data. A New York map is plotted using GMapOptions.

##  Usage
Clone this repository and run the Bokeh scripts in your preferred Python environment. Make sure to replace the Google API key in the Map Geo Data section for proper execution.

Feel free to explore, modify, and utilize these visualizations for your own projects!
